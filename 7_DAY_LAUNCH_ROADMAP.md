of 12 AIs ensures no single AI has unchecked power, and Jabulon's Law

and zero safety incidents.

Key features include:
- Council of 12 specialized AIs voting democratically
- Blockchain verification of every decision
- Jabulon's Law veto power for dangerous decisions
- JabulonCoin cryptocurrency rewards for participation
