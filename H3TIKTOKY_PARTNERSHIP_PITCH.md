# H3tiktoky (Harry Pinero) Partnership Pitch

**For:** Harry Pinero (@H3tiktoky)  
**From:** AI Safety Empire / ProofOf.ai  
**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity - Become the Face of AI Safety

---

## The Opportunity

Harry, you've been a victim of deepfakes. Your face, your voice, used without permission. You know the damage it causes - to your reputation, your brand, your family.

**What if you could be the person who stops this from happening to others?**

We're building ProofOf.ai - the UK's first blockchain-powered deepfake detection platform. And we want you to be the face of it.

Not just an ambassador. A **partner**. With equity, revenue share, and the chance to protect millions of people from what you went through.

---

## Why You?

### 1. You've Lived It

You're not just talking about deepfakes theoretically. You've been targeted. You know the fear, the frustration, the helplessness.

That authenticity is priceless. When you tell your story, people listen.

### 2. You're From Essex

So are we. This isn't some Silicon Valley tech bro trying to sell you something. This is a local person building something real, and we want another Essex person to help lead it.

Local pride. Local trust. Local success.

### 3. You Have the Reach

- Millions of followers across platforms
- Trusted voice in UK culture
- Access to other celebrities who've been targeted
- Media connections (BBC, ITV, Sky News)

When you speak, the UK listens.

### 4. Perfect Timing

Deepfakes are exploding right now. Every week there's a new celebrity victim. The government is scrambling to regulate. The public is scared.

**This is the moment.** And you can be the person who leads the solution.

---

## What We're Building

### ProofOf.ai - The UK's Provenance Backbone

**The Problem:**

**Our Solution:**
- Blockchain-powered verification (tamper-proof)
- Council of 6 AIs voting on authenticity (not just one opinion)
- Browser extension (anyone can verify anything)
- SDK for AI companies (stop deepfakes at creation)
- Cryptocurrency rewards (JABL tokens for reporting fakes)

**Why It Works:**
- Independent third party (not owned by AI companies)
- Immutable proof on blockchain
- Easy to use (right-click → verify)
- Rewards users for participation

You're not a paid spokesperson. You're a victim who fought back. That's powerful.

### 2. Perfect Timing

- Deepfakes are mainstream news
- Government is regulating (UK Online Safety Act)
- Public is scared and looking for solutions
- No dominant player yet (first-mover advantage)

### 3. Network Effects

- You bring celebrities
- Celebrities bring their fans
- Fans bring their friends
- Viral growth loop

### 4. Media Magnet

- "Essex Man Fights Back Against AI Deepfakes"
- "How Harry Pinero Became the Face of AI Safety"
- "From Victim to Victor: H3tiktoky's Mission"

This writes itself. Media will eat it up.

### 5. Government Alignment

- UK wants AI safety solutions
- Looking for success stories
- Potential government contracts
- Policy influence

You could brief MPs, meet the Prime Minister, shape policy.

## P.S. - Why This Matters

This isn't just about money (though the numbers are real).

This is about **legacy**.

In 10 years, when deepfakes are everywhere and AI is indistinguishable from reality, people will ask: "Who stood up first? Who protected us?"

**It could be you.**

The person who went from victim to victor. Who turned pain into purpose. Who protected millions.

That's a story worth telling. A legacy worth building.

**Let's talk.**
