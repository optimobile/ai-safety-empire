## üéì Answers to Your Questions

### "Do we need DigitalOcean?"
**No!** Railway is better for our use case:
- Free tier (500 hours/month)
- Auto-deploys from GitHub
- Easier to use
- Built-in monitoring
- Can upgrade later if needed

### "How do we link domains?"
**Simple!** You add DNS records in Namecheap:
1. I deploy to Railway/Vercel
2. They give me URLs
3. I give you DNS records to add
4. You paste them in Namecheap
5. Wait 5-60 minutes for propagation
6. Done!

I'll create a step-by-step guide with screenshots.

### "Should there be more than Three Laws?"
**YES!** I just created **Jabulon's 12 Laws** - a comprehensive, modern framework that goes far beyond Asimov's outdated 1942 fiction.

It covers:
- Human life and safety
- Human rights and dignity
- Transparency and explainability
- Fairness and non-discrimination
- Privacy and data protection
- Safety and security
- Human oversight and control
- Environmental sustainability
- Truth and honesty
- Beneficial purpose
- AGI-specific safety
- Democratic governance

**This is revolutionary!**

### "What else do we need to do?"
**Deployment (2-3 hours):**
- Railway backend
- Polygon Mumbai contracts
- Vercel websites
- DNS configuration

**Then launch (1 week):**
- Marketing materials
- Press release
- Product Hunt
- Social media
- AI company outreach

**Then scale (12 months):**
- Content automation
- Sales automation
- Support automation
- Mobile apps
- Government contracts
