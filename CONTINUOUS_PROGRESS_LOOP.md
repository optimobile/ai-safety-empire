## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** Platforms don't integrate properly  
**Mitigation:** Shared infrastructure, consistent architecture, continuous testing

**Risk:** Blockchain integration fails  
**Mitigation:** Test on local network first, then testnet, then mainnet

**Risk:** Performance issues at scale  
**Mitigation:** Load testing, caching, CDN, auto-scaling

### Business Risks

**Risk:** No market demand  
**Mitigation:** Validate with early customers, pivot if needed

**Risk:** Competitors emerge  
**Mitigation:** First-mover advantage, network effects, moats

**Risk:** Regulatory issues  
**Mitigation:** Legal review, compliance, government partnerships

### Execution Risks

**Risk:** Fall behind schedule  
**Mitigation:** Daily tracking, ruthless prioritization, cut scope if needed

**Risk:** Quality suffers  
**Mitigation:** Quality standards, code reviews, testing

**Risk:** Burnout  
**Mitigation:** Sustainable pace, celebrate wins, take breaks
