## 🔧 MISSING CONNECTORS ANALYSIS

### Currently Have ✅
- **Cloudflare MCP** - Workers, D1, R2, KV
- **Stripe MCP** - Payments, subscriptions
- **GitHub** - Via CLI (already working)

### Would Be Useful 🎯

**High Priority:**
- **SendGrid/Email MCP** - For user onboarding emails

- **Google Drive MCP** - For document sharing
  - Workaround: Use GitHub for now

**Medium Priority:**
- **Twitter/X MCP** - For marketing automation
  - Workaround: Manual posting for now
  
- **Discord/Slack MCP** - For community management
