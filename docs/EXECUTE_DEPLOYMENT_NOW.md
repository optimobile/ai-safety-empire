## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Smart Contracts Won't Deploy
- **Issue:** Not enough MATIC
- **Solution:** Get more from faucet or use different faucet

### Railway Deployment Fails
- **Issue:** Missing environment variables
- **Solution:** Double-check all variables are set correctly

### Vercel Domain Not Working
- **Issue:** DNS not propagated
- **Solution:** Wait 24 hours, clear DNS cache

### ProofOf.ai API Errors
- **Issue:** CORS or authentication
- **Solution:** Check CORS settings in Railway, verify API keys
