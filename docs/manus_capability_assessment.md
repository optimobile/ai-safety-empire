## Limitations and Workarounds

### Potential Limitations:
1. **Blockchain Node Hosting:** Manus may not directly host blockchain nodes
   - **Workaround:** Use Infura, Alchemy, or QuickNode for blockchain RPC access
   - **Cost:** $0-$50/month for development, $200-$500/month for production

2. **High-Volume Transaction Processing:** Blockchain gas fees can be expensive
   - **Workaround:** Use Polygon (Layer 2) for 1000x lower fees
   - **Cost:** $0.001 per transaction vs. $1-10 on Ethereum

3. **AI Model Training:** Manus may not train custom AI models from scratch
   - **Workaround:** Use fine-tuning of existing models (OpenAI, Hugging Face)
   - **Alternative:** Use pre-trained models for most tasks

4. **24/7 Human Support:** Manus cannot provide human customer support
   - **Workaround:** AI chatbot handles 90%+ of queries, escalate complex issues
   - **Solution:** Hire 1-2 support staff once revenue reaches £100k/month

### Overall Impact of Limitations:
- **Minimal:** All limitations have simple, cost-effective workarounds
- **Does NOT prevent 100% automation of core functionality**
- **Human involvement only needed for:**
  - Strategic business decisions
  - Complex customer negotiations
  - Legal/regulatory consultations (outsource to lawyers)
