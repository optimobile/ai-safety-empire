### Target Market:
- Large enterprises (1000+ integrations suggests enterprise focus)
- Internal AI governance teams
- NOT AI companies themselves
- NOT government regulators

### Key Differentiators from User's Ecosystem:
1. **Enterprise-focused vs. Industry-wide:** Securiti helps individual companies govern their AI. User's ecosystem governs the entire AI industry.
2. **Internal governance vs. External compliance:** Securiti is internal tool. User's ecosystem provides external verification and regulatory reporting.
3. **No blockchain:** Securiti has no immutable accountability layer.
4. **No crisis prevention:** Securiti doesn't prevent AI-related harms like suicide.
5. **No regulatory automation:** Securiti doesn't automatically report to governments.

### Conclusion:
**Securiti AI is NOT a competitor.** They serve a completely different market (enterprise internal governance) vs. user's ecosystem (industry-wide regulatory compliance and safety).
