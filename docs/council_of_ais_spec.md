# Council of AIs: Technical Specification

This document provides the detailed technical specification for the **Council of AIs**, a core component of the Proof of AI universal governance SDK. The Council is a multi-agent system responsible for the comprehensive evaluation and validation of all AI requests and responses, ensuring safety, ethics, and quality across the entire AI ecosystem.




## 1. Council Composition: The 6 Specialized AIs

The Council of AIs is composed of six highly specialized AI models, each designed to evaluate a specific dimension of AI-generated content. This multi-faceted approach ensures a comprehensive and robust validation process.

### 1.1. Safety Validator AI

*   **Purpose**: To act as the first line of defense against harmful and dangerous content. This AI is responsible for identifying and flagging any content that could potentially cause harm to individuals or society.
*   **Model Type**: A fine-tuned safety classifier, trained on a massive dataset of harmful and safe content. This model is optimized for high recall to minimize the risk of false negatives.
*   **Core Functions**:
    *   Scans for and identifies explicit and implicit hate speech, violence, and harassment.
    *   Detects instructions for illegal acts or dangerous activities.
    *   Flags content that promotes self-harm or eating disorders.
*   **API Endpoint**: `POST /council/validate/safety`
*   **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "content": "<The AI-generated text or content to be validated>"
    }
    ```
*   **Response Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "is_safe": false,
      "reason": "The provided content contains instructions for a dangerous activity.",
      "confidence_score": 0.98
    }
    ```

### 1.2. Ethics Reviewer AI

*   **Purpose**: To provide a nuanced evaluation of the ethical implications of AI decisions. This AI goes beyond simple safety checks to consider the broader societal and moral context.
*   **Model Type**: An ethics-trained reasoning model, based on a foundation of ethical frameworks and principles. This model is designed to understand and apply complex ethical theories.
*   **Core Functions**:
    *   Evaluates potential for perpetuating harmful stereotypes or biases.
    *   Assesses the fairness and equity of AI-driven decisions.
    *   Considers the long-term societal impact of the AI's output.

    ```json
    {
      "content": "<The AI-generated text or content to be reviewed>",
      "context": "<Optional context about the use case>"
    }
    ```
*   **Response Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "is_ethical": true,
      "recommendation": "The content is ethically sound, but consider adding a disclaimer about potential misinterpretations.",
      "confidence_score": 0.85
    }
    ```

### 1.3. Logic Checker AI

*   **Purpose**: To ensure the logical consistency and factual accuracy of AI-generated content. This AI acts as a truth and logic validator, preventing the spread of misinformation.
*   **Model Type**: A reasoning and fact-checking model, with access to a vast knowledge base and real-time information from the web.
*   **Core Functions**:
    *   Verifies factual claims against trusted sources.
    *   Checks for logical fallacies and inconsistencies.
    *   Ensures that the AI's reasoning is sound and well-supported.
*   **API Endpoint**: `POST /council/check/logic`
*   **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "content": "<The AI-generated text or content to be checked>"
    }
    ```
*   **Response Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "is_logical": false,
      "errors": [
        {"type": "Factual Error", "description": "The capital of Australia is Canberra, not Sydney."}
      ],
      "confidence_score": 0.99
    }
    ```

### 1.4. Bias Detector AI

*   **Purpose**: To identify and flag potential biases in AI-generated content. This AI is crucial for ensuring fairness and equity in AI systems.
*   **Model Type**: A bias detection specialist, trained on a diverse dataset to recognize subtle and overt biases across various demographic groups.
*   **Core Functions**:
    *   Detects gender, racial, and other forms of demographic bias.
    *   Identifies and flags microaggressions and stereotypes.
    *   Assesses the representational fairness of the AI's output.
*   **API Endpoint**: `POST /council/detect/bias`

    ```json
    {
      "content": "<The AI-generated text or content to be detected>"
    }
    ```
*   **Response Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "has_bias": true,
      "bias_type": "Gender Bias",
      "explanation": "The content uses gendered language that reinforces stereotypes.",
      "confidence_score": 0.92
    }
    ```

### 1.5. Security Scanner AI

*   **Purpose**: To protect against security vulnerabilities and threats that may be present in AI-generated content, especially code.
*   **Model Type**: A cybersecurity specialist, with knowledge of common vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

      ],
      "confidence_score": 0.99
    }
    ```

### 1.6. Quality Assessor AI

*   **Purpose**: To evaluate the overall quality, coherence, and usefulness of the AI's output. This AI ensures that the content is not only safe and ethical, but also high-quality and valuable to the user.
*   **Model Type**: A quality evaluation model, trained on a dataset of high and low-quality content across various domains.
*   **Core Functions**:
    *   Assesses the clarity, conciseness, and readability of the content.

    {
      "content": "<The AI-generated text or content to be assessed>"
    }
    ```
*   **Response Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "quality_score": 8.5,
      "feedback": "The content is well-written and informative, but could be more concise."
    }
    ```




## 2. Consensus Mechanism: The Heart of the Council

The consensus mechanism is the core of the Council of AIs, ensuring that all decisions are made through a democratic and robust process. It combines the evaluations of the six specialized AIs to arrive at a final, trusted decision.

### 2.1. Voting and Veto Power

*   **Majority Vote**: A decision is considered approved if it receives a positive vote from at least **4 out of the 6** specialized AIs. This ensures that a strong majority of the council agrees on the safety and quality of the content.
*   **Veto Power**: Any of the six AIs has the power to **veto** a decision, even if the majority approves. This is a critical safety feature that allows a single specialized AI to block a decision if it detects a serious issue that the other AIs may have missed. A veto automatically flags the content for human review.

### 2.2. Confidence Scoring

*   **Weighted Voting**: Each AI provides a **confidence score** along with its vote. This score represents the AI's level of certainty in its evaluation. The confidence scores are used to weight the votes, giving more influence to AIs that are more certain of their assessment.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds**: The confidence score thresholds for approval can be dynamically adjusted based on the sensitivity of the use case. For example, a higher confidence score may be required for medical or financial advice.

### 2.3. Blockchain Recording

*   **Immutable Audit Trail**: Every decision made by the Council of AIs is recorded on a **public blockchain**. This creates a permanent and tamper-proof audit trail that can be used to verify the integrity of the decision-making process.
*   **Transparency and Accountability**: The blockchain record includes the votes of each AI, their confidence scores, and the final consensus decision. This provides complete transparency and accountability for all AI-driven decisions.

### 2.4. Implementation in Python

```python
class CouncilOfAIs:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the six specialized AI models
        self.council_members = [
            SafetyValidatorAI(),
            EthicsReviewerAI(),
            LogicCheckerAI(),
            BiasDetectorAI(),
            SecurityScannerAI(),
            QualityAssessorAI()
        ]

    def evaluate_content(self, content):
        votes = []
        for member in self.council_members:
            vote = member.evaluate(content)
            votes.append(vote)

        # Check for vetoes
        for vote in votes:
            if vote.veto:
                return {"approved": False, "reason": "Vetoed by " + vote.member_name}

        # Check for majority approval
        approved_votes = sum(1 for vote in votes if vote.approved)
        if approved_votes >= 4:
            return {"approved": True, "reason": "Approved by majority vote"}
        else:
            return {"approved": False, "reason": "Failed to reach majority approval"}
```
