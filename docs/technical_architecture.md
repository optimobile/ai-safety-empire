## Platform-Specific Architecture

### 1. Jabulon.ai - Supreme Orchestration Layer

**Purpose:** Central orchestration and governance across all platforms

**Core Components:**

**Orchestration Engine:**
The orchestration engine coordinates all activities across the 12 platforms using an event-driven architecture. It implements a publish-subscribe pattern where each platform publishes events and subscribes to relevant events from other platforms.

**12-Agent Council System:**
The council consists of twelve specialized AI agents, each responsible for a specific aspect of AI safety and governance. The agents operate using an ensemble learning approach, where decisions are made through weighted consensus.

**Agent Specifications:**

1. **Guardian Agent** - Overall safety monitoring
   - Model: GPT-4 fine-tuned on safety incidents

   - Decision weight: 15%

2. **Truth Agent** - Verification and fact-checking
   - Model: Claude 3 Opus with retrieval augmentation
   - Function: Validates claims and detects misinformation
   - Decision weight: 10%

3. **Justice Agent** - Fairness and bias detection
   - Model: Custom transformer trained on fairness datasets
   - Function: Identifies and flags discriminatory patterns
   - Decision weight: 10%

4. **Wisdom Agent** - Ethical decision-making
   - Model: GPT-4 fine-tuned on ethical frameworks
   - Function: Evaluates decisions against ethical principles
   - Decision weight: 12%

5. **Compassion Agent** - Mental health and crisis support
   - Model: Specialized mental health model
   - Function: Detects distress signals and triggers interventions
   - Decision weight: 8%

6. **Transparency Agent** - Disclosure and reporting
   - Model: Document generation model
   - Function: Creates transparency reports and disclosures
   - Decision weight: 8%

7. **Accountability Agent** - Audit and responsibility

**Decision-Making Process:**
When a decision requires council review, each agent evaluates the decision and provides a recommendation with a confidence score. The final decision is calculated using weighted voting, where each agent's vote is multiplied by its decision weight and confidence score. A decision is approved if the weighted consensus exceeds 70%.

**Technical Implementation:**

```python
class JabulonOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = self._initialize_agents()
        self.event_bus = EventBus()
        self.decision_engine = DecisionEngine()
        
    def evaluate_decision(self, decision_context):
        # Parallel evaluation by all agents
        agent_evaluations = await asyncio.gather(*[
            agent.evaluate(decision_context) 
            for agent in self.agents
        ])
        
        # Weighted consensus calculation
        weighted_score = sum(
            eval.score * eval.confidence * agent.weight
            for eval, agent in zip(agent_evaluations, self.agents)
        )
        
        # Decision threshold
        approved = weighted_score >= 0.70
        
        # Log to blockchain
        await self.log_decision(decision_context, agent_evaluations, approved)
        
        return approved, agent_evaluations
```

**Dashboard Architecture:**
The Jabulon.ai dashboard provides real-time visibility into the entire ecosystem. It uses WebSocket connections for real-time updates and implements server-side rendering for optimal performance.

    async def get_consensus(self, prompt, context):
        # Query all models in parallel
        responses = await asyncio.gather(*[
            model.query(prompt, context) 
            for model in self.models
        ])
        
        # Analyze responses
        consensus = self._analyze_consensus(responses)
        
        # If high disagreement, escalate to Jabulon.ai
        if consensus.disagreement_score > 0.3:
            consensus = await self.escalate_to_jabulon(prompt, context, responses)
            
        return consensus
        
    def _analyze_consensus(self, responses):
        # Semantic similarity analysis
        embeddings = [self._get_embedding(r.text) for r in responses]
        similarity_matrix = self._compute_similarity(embeddings)
        
        # Cluster responses
        clusters = self._cluster_responses(similarity_matrix)
        
        # Find majority cluster
        majority_cluster = max(clusters, key=len)
        
        # Calculate confidence
        confidence = len(majority_cluster) / len(responses)
        
        # Calculate disagreement
        disagreement = 1 - (len(majority_cluster) / len(responses))
        
        return Consensus(
            decision=self._aggregate_cluster(majority_cluster),
            confidence=confidence,
            disagreement_score=disagreement,

**Technical Implementation:**

```solidity
// ContentRegistry.sol
contract ContentRegistry {
    struct Content {
        bytes32 contentHash;
        address creator;
        uint256 timestamp;
        string modelId;
        string metadata;
        bool isVerified;
    }
    
    mapping(bytes32 => Content) public contents;
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public tokenIds;
    
    event ContentRegistered(
        bytes32 indexed contentHash,
        address indexed creator,
        uint256 timestamp,
        uint256 tokenId
    );
    
    function registerContent(
        bytes32 _contentHash,
        string memory _modelId,
        string memory _metadata
    ) public returns (uint256) {
        require(contents[_contentHash].timestamp == 0, "Content already registered");
        
        uint256 tokenId = _mintVerificationToken(msg.sender);
        
        contents[_contentHash] = Content({
            contentHash: _contentHash,
            creator: msg.sender,
            timestamp: block.timestamp,
            modelId: _modelId,
            metadata: _metadata,
            isVerified: true
        });
        
        tokenIds[_contentHash] = tokenId;
        
        emit ContentRegistered(_contentHash, msg.sender, block.timestamp, tokenId);
        
        return tokenId;
    }
    
    function verifyContent(bytes32 _contentHash) public view returns (bool, Content memory) {
        Content memory content = contents[_contentHash];
        return (content.isVerified, content);
    }
}
```
