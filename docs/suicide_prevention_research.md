### 2.2. Multi-AI Safety Council

The Multi-AI Safety Council is a decentralized network of specialized AI models that work together to analyze and adjudicate potentially harmful content. The council is composed of six specialized AIs, each with a specific role:

1.  **The Ethicist**: Analyzes the ethical implications of the content.
2.  **The Psychologist**: Assesses the psychological state of the user.
3.  **The Linguist**: Analyzes the nuances of the language used.
4.  **The Behaviorist**: Identifies patterns of behavior that may indicate risk.
5.  **The Risk Assessor**: Quantifies the level of risk and the probability of harm.
6.  **The Interventionist**: Recommends the appropriate intervention.

**Consensus Mechanism**:

The council uses a weighted voting consensus mechanism to make decisions. Each AI model is assigned a weight based on its area of expertise and its historical accuracy. A decision is reached when a supermajority of the council (e.g., 75%) agrees on a course of action.

### 2.3. Blockchain Verification Layer
