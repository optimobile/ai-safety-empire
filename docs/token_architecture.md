# AI Safety Empire: Token Architecture and Economic Model

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the token architecture and economic model for the AI Safety Empire's native cryptocurrency, **Aegis (AEGIS)**. The Aegis token is designed to be the economic backbone of the ecosystem, incentivizing participation, funding development, and aligning the interests of all stakeholders.

## 2. Token Architecture

### 2.1. Token Details

*   **Name:** Aegis
*   **Symbol:** AEGIS
*   **Type:** Utility and Governance Token
*   **Blockchain:** A high-throughput, low-cost Layer 1 blockchain (e.g., Solana) with a potential for a custom AI-focused blockchain in the future.

### 2.2. Core Utility

The AEGIS token will have a wide range of utilities across the four platforms:

*   **Councilof.ai:** Staking AEGIS will be required to participate in the governance of the AI Safety Empire, including voting on proposals and electing council members.
*   **ASISecurity.ai:** Enterprises will use AEGIS to pay for subscription fees and access premium features.
*   **AGIsafe.ai:** Developers will use AEGIS to access advanced bias detection and mitigation tools.
*   **SuicideStop.ai:** AI platforms will use AEGIS to pay for API access and to contribute to the platform's development.

## 3. Economic Model

### 3.1. Total Supply and Allocation

*   **Total Supply:** 100,000,000,000 AEGIS (100 billion)
*   **Ecosystem Fund (40%):** 40 billion AEGIS will be allocated to the ecosystem fund to support the long-term development of the AI Safety Empire.
*   **Team and Advisors (20%):** 20 billion AEGIS will be allocated to the team and advisors, with a 4-year vesting schedule.
*   **Public Sale (20%):** 20 billion AEGIS will be sold to the public to raise initial funding for the project.
*   **Community and Airdrops (10%):** 10 billion AEGIS will be distributed to the community through airdrops and other engagement programs.
*   **Foundation Reserve (10%):** 10 billion AEGIS will be held in a foundation reserve for strategic partnerships and future initiatives.

### 3.2. Staking and Governance

*   **Staking:** Users will be able to stake their AEGIS tokens to earn rewards and participate in governance.
*   **Governance:** Staked AEGIS will represent voting power in the AI Safety Empire's decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The DAO will be responsible for making key decisions about the future of the ecosystem.

### 3.3. Vesting Schedule

*   **Team and Advisors:** 4-year vesting with a 1-year cliff. This means that team members and advisors will not receive any tokens for the first year, and will then receive their tokens gradually over the following three years.

## 4. Value Accrual

The value of the AEGIS token will be driven by a number of factors:

*   **Platform Usage:** As the adoption of the four platforms grows, the demand for the AEGIS token will increase.
*   **Staking Rewards:** The staking rewards will create a strong incentive for users to hold and stake their AEGIS tokens.
*   **Token Burns:** A portion of the fees generated by the four platforms will be used to buy back and burn AEGIS tokens, reducing the total supply and increasing the value of the remaining tokens.
*   **Governance Rights:** The ability to participate in the governance of the AI Safety Empire will be a valuable right, driving demand for the AEGIS token.
