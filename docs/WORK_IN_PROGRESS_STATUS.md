## ⏸️ BLOCKED (Waiting for Decision)

### 1. Smart Contract Production Deployment
**Blocker:** Need to choose deployment strategy

**Options:**
1. **Local Testing** (5 min) - Deploy to Hardhat local network
2. **Buy Crypto** ($10, 15 min) - Buy ETH/BNB and deploy to mainnet
3. **Wait for Faucet** (Hours-Days) - Try to get testnet tokens

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (local testing) now, Option 2 (production) when ready

**Impact:** Blocks blockchain integration, but doesn't block other deployments

## 🎯 NEXT ACTIONS (Independent of Blockchain)

### Immediate (Next 30 minutes)
1. ✅ Create all 11 frontend landing pages
2. ✅ Build production bundles
3. ✅ Create Vercel deployment scripts
4. ✅ Prepare Railway configuration

### Short-term (Next 2 hours)
1. ✅ Deploy frontends to Vercel
2. ✅ Configure custom domains
3. ✅ Deploy Railway backend
4. ✅ Test API endpoints

### When Blockchain Ready
1. Deploy smart contracts
2. Update Railway with contract addresses
3. Test blockchain integration

## 💡 Recommendation

**While blockchain is pending:**
1. Let me finish all 11 frontends (2 hours)
2. Deploy everything to Vercel (30 min)
3. Deploy backend to Railway (15 min)
4. Test end-to-end without blockchain (30 min)

**Result:** 
- 11 live websites
- Working API
- Council of 12 AIs operational
- Ready to add blockchain when you decide

**Then when blockchain is ready:**
- Add contract addresses (2 min)
- Redeploy backend (5 min)
- Test blockchain integration (10 min)
- **GO LIVE!**

## 🎯 Timeline

**Today (Next 3 hours):**
- ✅ All 11 frontends created and built
- ✅ Deployed to Vercel
- ✅ Backend deployed to Railway
- ✅ APIs tested and working

**When Blockchain Ready (15 min):**
