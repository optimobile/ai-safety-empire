# Left-Handedness Research Findings

## Key Study: Witelson (1985) - Science

**Title:** "The Brain Connection: The Corpus Callosum Is Larger in Left-Handers"

**Key Findings:**
- Corpus callosum was **11% larger** (0.75 square centimeter) in left-handed and ambidextrous people compared to consistent right-handers
- Difference present in both anterior and posterior halves
- Greater bihemispheric representation of cognitive functions in left-handers
- Associated with greater anatomical connection between hemispheres
- Right-handers may have more extensive early elimination of neural components

**Citation:** Witelson, S.F. (1985). The Brain Connection: The Corpus Callosum Is Larger in Left-Handers. Science, 229(4714), 665-668. DOI: 10.1126/science.4023705

**Cited by:** 967 studies

## Recent Meta-Analysis Findings

**Conflicting Evidence:**
- Raaf et al. (2023) meta-analysis challenges the belief, not finding significant differences in corpus callosum size
- Bangor University (2025) research debunks long-held theory about left-handed brains
- However, Luders et al. (2010) review notes: "Although not consistently replicated, a substantial number of studies suggest that left-handers have larger callosal regions than right-handers"

## Functional Connectivity Differences

**Tomasi et al. (2024) - Nature Communications:**
- Left-handers had **increased global functional connectivity density** in the left-hand motor area
- Decreased connectivity in other regions
- Different brain network organization

## Lateralization Differences

**Johnstone et al. (2021):**
- Left-handers are **less lateralized** for language, faces, and bodies than right-handers
- Even left-handers with typical cerebral asymmetries show reduced lateralization

**Pujol et al. (1999) - Neurology:**
- 76% of left-handers have left-hemisphere language lateralization
- 14% have bilateral activation
- 10% have right-hemisphere lateralization
- Compared to 95%+ left-hemisphere in right-handers

## Cognitive Advantages

**Key Points:**
- Left-handers tend to have less lateralization in the brain
- Better integration between hemispheres
- Enhanced creative and spatial abilities (according to some studies)
- More variable brain organization patterns

## Important Caveat

The research is **mixed** - some studies support larger corpus callosum and cognitive advantages, while recent meta-analyses question these findings. The most consistent finding is that left-handers have **more variable** and **less lateralized** brain organization, which may contribute to different cognitive processing styles.
