# Jabulon's 12 Laws of AI Safety

**A Modern, Comprehensive Framework for AI and Robotics Safety**

*Going Beyond Asimov's Three Laws (1942) with 21st Century AI Safety Principles*

---

## Introduction

Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, written in 1942, were revolutionary for their time but are inadequate for modern AI systems, AGI, and autonomous robotics. They were designed for fictional robots in science fiction stories, not for real-world AI that processes data, makes decisions, and impacts billions of lives.

**Jabulon's 12 Laws** represent a comprehensive, modern framework based on:
- Latest AI safety research (2024-2025)
- UNESCO's AI Ethics Recommendation
- Google's AI Principles
- Microsoft's Responsible AI framework
- Real-world AI governance needs
- AGI safety considerations
- Human rights and dignity
- Environmental sustainability

These laws are designed to be:
- **Enforceable** through blockchain verification
- **Measurable** through AI monitoring
- **Comprehensive** covering all aspects of AI safety
- **Future-proof** applicable to current and future AI systems
- **Democratic** governed by the Council of 12 AIs
